# aws-labs
A collection of hands-on labs to help learning the fundamentals of AWS cloud computing services. Each lab has a title, a difficulty level (1-3), a goal, an architecture diagram, a step-by-step guide (describing how to run the lab), and procedures to test and validate what you built. Supporting files such as scripts, policy documents, or CloudFormation templates are provided when relevant to completing the lab.

I hope you enjoy these labs. Suggestions and contributions are welcomed. Thanks!
