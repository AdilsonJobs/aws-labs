# aws-labs
A collection of hands-on labs to help learning the fundamentals of AWS cloud computing services. Each lab has a title, a difficulty level (1-3), a goal, an architecture diagram, a step-by-step guide describing how to run the lab, and a test/validation final procedures. Lab supportive files (scripts, CloudFormation templates, etc.) are provided when relevant for the lab completion.

I hope you enjoy these labs. And you are welcome to contribute to this repository by sending pull requests. Thanks!
