# aws-labs
A collection of hands-on labs to help learning the fundamentals of AWS cloud computing services. Each lab has:

* a title,
* a difficulty level (1-3),
* a goal,
* an architecture diagram,
* a step-by-step guide, describing how to run the lab, with textual and visual information,
* links to AWS documentation or other relevant information, and
* procedures to test and validate the lab.

Supporting files such as scripts, policy documents, and CloudFormation templates are provided when relevant to completing the lab.

I hope you enjoy these labs. Suggestions and contributions are welcomed. Thanks!
