## Description
In this lab you are asked to start an EC2 instance (you can use the "Amazon Linux 2 AMI" with default settings).  The instance must be created in a public subnet configured to auto-assign a public IP address.  The instance must be accessible by SSH. We suggest creating a security group named "ssh-access."
