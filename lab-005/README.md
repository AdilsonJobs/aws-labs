## Overview
AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service supports three types of load balancers:
* Application Load Balancer,
* Network Load Balancer, and
* Classic Load Balancer.

As the name suggests, the Application Load Balancer works at the application layer and understands protocols such as HTTP. This gives the load balancer the ability to support routing rules based on the URL or the host field in the HTTP header, for example. 

## Test and Validation
Provide some guidance on how to test the lab and validate whether it is doing what is suppose to do.
