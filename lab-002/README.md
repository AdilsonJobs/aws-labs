## Goal
The goal of this lab is to demonstrate how to access a Linux EC2 instance launched in a private subnet from a internet host via SSH.

## Overview

In order to achieve the goal of this lab, you will have to go through the following steps:

1. Create a new VPC with the *Name tag* lab-002 and the *IPv4 CIDR block* 192.168.0.0/16.
2. Create an *Internet gateway* with the *Name tag* lab-002 and attach it to lab-002 VPC.
3. Create a public subnet on lab-002 with the *Name tag* public and *IPv4 CIDR block* 192.168.100.0/24.  
4. Enable *Auto-assign IPV4* in the newly created public subnet.
5. Edit the route table of the public subnet adding a default route to *Internet gateway* lab-002.
6. Create a private subnet on lab-002 with the *Name tag* private and the *IPv4 CIDR block* 192.168.200.0/24.
7. Launch two EC2 instances using the procedure described in [lab-001](../lab-001); make sure that each subnet has one of the instances.

## Test
1. First add the EC2 key pair into your local ssh authentication agent using:

```
ssh-add -K lab-002.pem (macos)
ssh-add -c lab-002.pem (linux)
```

2. Then connect to the EC2 instance A but with ssh agent forwarding enabled:  

```
ssh -A ec2-user@<public-IP of A>
```
3. Finally, from EC2 instance A ssh to the EC2 instance B using its private IP address:

```
ssh <private-IP of B>
```
